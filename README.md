# Items API

##  Setup -----------

create a directory titled "items-api"

go into the directory and add a server.js and an app.js file (in that order)

add mvc folders for MVC(Models folder, Views folder(not necessary now), Controllers folder) as well as a routes folder

add a .gitignore file then run "npm init -y " command to initialize node environment

run "npm i express mongoose morgan dotenv" to add these dependencies, add a .env file to to your projects root directory and inside add "node_modules" and ".env" to have it ignore pushing these files to github.

inside your package.json in your scripts section add a "dev" script that is set to "nodemon server.js"

Initialize your file as a github repo in your terminal by running "git init" in your terminal

  ## Pushing To Github ------------
  Go to "Github.com/new", create a new repo on Github and name it appropriately

  In your terminal run "git add -A", then run "git commit -m "(add relevant message for what's been done")

  Then paste the code for pushing an existing repository from the command line into your terminal
